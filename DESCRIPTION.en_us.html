  Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts.
Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters&acirc;&euro;&trade; thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics.
The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal.
Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.
</p>The font&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face &acirc;&euro;&tilde;modern&acirc;&euro;&trade; or &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Didone&acirc;&euro;&trade; style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and the size of its capital letters so small &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters&acirc;&euro;&trade; serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.
<p>
  The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script.
When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes.
However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.
